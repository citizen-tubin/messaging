Hi there Active Fence members, several things before we start:

1. REST Logic:
   In order to test my REST logic, please install Extention: "REST Client" (By Huachao Mao).
   Afterwards send requests from 'requests.http' file

2. Tests:
   end to end tests are described at 'queue.e2e-spec.ts' file, executed by CLI command 'npm run test:e2e'
